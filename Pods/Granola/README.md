# Granola

_*A healthful serializer for your HealthKit data.*_

## Overview

So you want to store your app's [HealthKit](https://developer.apple.com/healthkit/)
data somewhere *outside* of HealthKit, perhaps a remote server for analysis or
backup? Use Granola to serialize your data.

Granola spares you the effort of mapping HealthKit's API to JSON yourself,
and emits JSON that validates against
[schemas developed by Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/developers/schemas/)
to ensure the data is intuitive and clinically meaningful.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Granola is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod "Granola"
```

## Usage

### Quick start

First, be sure to study Apple's
[HealthKit Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/HealthKit/Reference/HealthKit_Framework),
which includes code samples illustrating how to ask your app's user for
permission to access their HealthKit data, and how to query that data after
you've gained permission.

Now, let's say you want to see what a "steps" sample data point looks like
serialized to JSON.

```objective-c
// Granola includes OMHSerializer for serializing HealthKit data
#import "OMHSerializer.h"

// (initialize your HKHealthStore instance, request permissions with it)
// ...

// create a query for steps data
HKSampleType *stepsSampleType =
  [HKSampleType quantityTypeForIdentifier:HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount];
HKSampleQuery* query =
  [[HKSampleQuery alloc] initWithSampleType:stepsSampleType
                                  predicate:nil
                                      limit:HKObjectQueryNoLimit
                            sortDescriptors:nil
                             resultsHandler:^(HKSampleQuery *query,
                                              NSArray *results,
                                              NSError *error) {
     if (!results) abort();
     // pick a sample to serialize
     HKQuantitySample *sample = [results first];
     // create and use a serializer instance
     OMHSerializer *serializer = [OMHSerializer new];
     NSString* jsonString = [serializer jsonForSample:sample error:nil];
     NSLog(@"sample json: %@", jsonString);
   }];
// run the query with your authorized HKHealthStore instance
[self.healthStore executeQuery:query];
```

Upon running your code, the console would render the data sample as Open mHealth compliant JSON:

```json
{
  "body" : {
    "step_count" : 45,
    "effective_time_frame" : {
      "time_interval" : {
        "start_date_time" : "2015-05-12T18:58:06.969Z",
        "end_date_time" : "2015-05-12T18:58:32.524Z"
      }
    }
  },
  "header" : {
    "id" : "4A00E553-B01D-4757-ADD0-A4283BABAC6F",
    "creation_date_time" : "2015-05-12T18:58:06.969Z",
    "schema_id" : {
      "namespace" : "omh",
      "name" : "step-count",
      "version" : "1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### HKObjectType support

The serializer has support for all HealthKit samples (HKSample), either through curated Open mHealth schemas or through generic HealthKit schemas. The list of supported types along with their associated schemas is viewable [here](Docs/hkobject_type_coverage.md). The HKObjectType identifiers are pulled from the
[HealthKit Constant Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/HealthKit/Reference/HealthKit_Constants/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014710-CH2-DontLinkElementID_3). 

Over time, as curated schemas are developed that correspond to the HealthKit data represented by the generic schemas, the generic mappings will be replaced by mappings to the curated schemas.
